# Push_Or_Perish
The project uses a 7-segment display, two buttons, and two LEDs to create a simple competitive game scenario. The main goal is to count down from 3 to 0 on the 7-segment display and determine the winner based on when the players press their buttons (either before or after the countdown reaches 0)
